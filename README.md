# Secure Multimodal Medical Data Fusion using Quantum Security

## Overview
This project implements a multimodal medical diagnosis system using:
- Vision Transformer (ViT) for medical images
- BioBERT for clinical text
- Attention-based fusion
- Quantum-enhanced security for model protection

## Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Extraction (ViT + BioBERT)
3. Multimodal Training
4. Quantum Signature & Encryption
5. Streamlit Web Application

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
